Final Project:
Blackjack card game




Basic Blackjack game: 
1. User gets two cards, the dealer (computer) gets two cards - with one card face up. The player can decide whether to continue to ‘hit’ the cards (get dealt another one) or ‘stand’ (stop). If the player does not go above 21, the computer’s cards are shown, and they hit until they reach a hard 17 (17 not made up of A & 6) or higher. Higher number wins the hand. 
Added Components:
1. Betting: Player starts off with X amount of dollars and can bet up to 5 times the betting amount. 
2. Double Down: The concept where if a player has a 9, 10, or 11, they can ‘double down’ (add double the amount of money they have in) and receive only one more card.
Potential Extra Components (as time/skill allows):
1. Multiple players
2. Splitting: If the player has two of the same cards (ie: 9 9, etc.) they can split them (add more to the bet) and then play each hand like normal.
