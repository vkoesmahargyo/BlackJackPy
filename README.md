FINAL VERSION:
</br>
The main game is run through Final_Project.py. The game is fully functional for a single player, with hit, stand and doubling down options, multiple (six) decks of cards, and betting implementation.
</br>
The multiplayer version of the game, Final_Project_Multiplayer.py runs and is fully functional but has not been fully tested. It incorporates all functionality of the main game, and can handle up to 4 players.
</br>
We've also kept other parts of our code that was used in testing the game in a separate folder within the ITP_FINAL_PROJECT repository.

Basic Blackjack game description: 
</br>
User gets two cards, the dealer (computer) gets two cards - with one card face up. The player can decide whether to continue to ‘hit’ the cards (get dealt another one) or ‘stand’ (stop). If the player does not go above 21, the computer’s cards are shown, and they hit until they reach a hard 17 (17 not made up of A & 6) or higher. Higher number wins the hand. 
</br>
Added Components:
